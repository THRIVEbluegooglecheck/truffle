fuelcells are stored in your backpack, access its inventory with the "p key"
view your fuel cells' stats with the "i key". 
Each fuel cell is stored in the back pack you collected earlier from the dead collector's body.
It has room for 8 fuel cells in it.
Your mana is a derivative of your THRIVEpack's fuel cells.
The energy from the THRIVEpack is what allows you to cast your magic,
when you run out of energy in your fuel cells, you run out of mana,
and you must rely on your atp.
mana is the inverse function of atp.
mana must be derived from fuel cells, atp is derived from the unvierse naturally.
atp gains at a rate of  33 per second with a max of 198atp.
